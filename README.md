# taxonomyExtract
A simple shell command compliation to obtain a list of taxonomic names.

You may need to customize the code according to your requirements.

For example I needed to obtain a list of as much as bacteria as possible to create a drop-down menu for this web app.

So I first obtained a CSV from this NCBI webpage for prokaryotes:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/prokaryotes/refseq_category:reference

Then after renaming this file accordingly, I ran the shell commands at the same directory.
